  title: Why Gull Pond
  description: >
    This 1200 square foot open-plan three-bedroom house looks out on beautiful Gull Pond. 
    Surrounded by pine and sycamore, this restful setting is a perfect retreat from city 
    life. Just steps from the spacious deck is the pond, great for swimming. Newcomb Hollow 
    Beach is a 1/4 mile walk; the town of Wellfleet, a short drive.

        The house is positioned between freshwater and salt. Sitting on the deck you will 
        hear ocean waves breaking in the distance and Gull Pond lapping at the canoe 
        landing thirty steps away.The house interior has 1200 square feet, with three 
        bedrooms, a kitchen, living room, and a deck with a gas grill and a wooden 
        stairway to Gull Pond. Newcomb 
        Hollow Beach is a quarter-mile walk through the trees.

        Just minutes away from the town of Wellfleet, located halfway between the tip 
        and elbow of Cape Cod. The town had a population of 2,750 at the 2010 census, 
        which swells nearly sixfold during the summer.

        Provincetown is just down the Cape. The seaside town is on the site of the 
        Mayflower's landing in 1620, commemorated by the towering Pilgrim Monument and 
        neighboring Provincetown Museum. Numerous galleries plus restaurants, nightclubs, 
        cabarets and specialty shops are clustered on and around lively Commercial Street.

        the Cape is also blessed with a 200+ freshwater kettle ponds scattered 
        throughout the various communities.  A dip in the cool, clear waters of a 
        cherished pond is a favorite Cape Cod memory for residents and visitors alike.  
        Henry David Thoreau famously visited the Wellfleet ponds in the mid-1800s, 
        later remarking on them in Cape Cod.

    Our host took pleasure in telling us the names of the ponds, most of which we could 
    see from his windows, and making us repeat them after him, to see if we had got them 
    right. They were Gull Pond, the largest and a very handsome one, clear and deep, and 
    more than a mile in circumference, Newcomb’s, Swett’s, Slough, Horse-Leech, Round, and 
    Herring Ponds, all connected at high water, if I do not mistake.
