### Gull Pond
Swim. Discover the three connected ponds. This is one of the largest fresh-water ponds in Wellfleet, Gull Pond has a nice shady beach and warm water. Rent boats a mile from the house. This is a great spot if you are looking to explore some of the non-ocean waters. 

### Newcomb Hollow State Beach
A popular beach destination in the summer, Newcomb Hollow, is bordered by sand dunes. The sand is white and soft and the water is refreshing. You descend and ascend steep sand dunes to access the beach. Clear water and almost no rocks, shells or seaweed. Fun surf, not crowded if you walk a bit. Food truck in the parking lot. Fires allowed on the beach with a Fire Permit from Wellfleet.

### Great Island Trail
This trail follows sandy stretches between the elevated heights of Great Island and Great Beach Hill. Its higher elevations punctuate spectacular vistas which emerge from an even-aged, pitch-pine forest. Part of this trail leads to a colonial-era tavern site (no remains visible). Other sections skirt salt marshes. Give yourself three to five hours to explore Great Island.

### Marconi and the South Wellfleet Wireless
Guglielmo Marconi sought to transmit wireless signals across the Atlantic. He built stations in England, Nova Scotia, and South Wellfleet, Massachusetts. At this stage of wireless technology relatively long electromagnetic waves were used as signals. Transmitting great distances, therefore, required great sensitivity of receivers and tremendous power. Huge rings of masts were installed to support the needed antennas. After  storms destroyed the masts, they were replaced wooden towers, 210 feet in height. The first successful two-way transatlantic wireless test message was sent on December 17, 1902.

### Biking
Biking is a favorite activity of many visitors to Cape Cod National Seashore. Bike racks are provided at the seashore's public facilities. There are three bike trails in the seashore: Nauset in Eastham, Head of the Meadow in Truro, and Province Lands in Provincetown. The Cape Cod Rail Trail runs 26 miles between the towns of Dennis and Wellfleet.
