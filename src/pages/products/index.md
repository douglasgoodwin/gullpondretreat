  This open-plan three-bedroom house looks out on beautiful Gull Pond. Surrounded by pine   
  and sycamore, this restful setting is a perfect retreat from city life. Just steps from 
  the spacious deck is the pond, great for swimming. Newcomb Hollow Beach is a 1/4 mile walk; the town of Wellfleet, a short drive.

        The house is positioned between freshwater and salt. Sitting on the deck you will 
        hear ocean waves breaking in the distance and Gull Pond lapping at the canoe 
        landing thirty steps away.

    kettle holes, as they are commonly called). Golfers and cyclists have great 
    opportunities to enjoy their respective sports. Beach enthusiasts can pick from 
    several beautiful public beaches, including Marconi, Indian Neck and Cahoons Hollow.
